## 1.4.0

- Feat: Returning an observable in a computed creates a two-way link to the target observable.
- Feat: `computed` is supported as a child of an observable
- Feat: `proxy` is like a `computed` but given a key, usable by indexing into an object with a string key
- Feat: Functions and computeds in the hierarchy of the constructing object in an observable are extracted into observable metadata so that setting the observable does not delete them.

## 1.1.0

- Perf: Listeners are batched uniquely so that each listener will fire only once for all of the changes within a batch
- Change: Array filter and find return the observable instead of the raw data.

## 1.0.0

After an unexpectly large number of changes while in RC, 1.0 includes tons of improvements and fixes that can broadly be categorized as:

- Improved persistence plugin system
- Added two-way `computed`
- Performance improvements
- A few minor breaking changes - see https://legendapp.com/open-source/state/migrating/

See https://legendapp.com/open-source/legend-state-v1/ for more details.

## 1.0.0-rc.34

## 1.0.0-rc.33

- Perf: Improve performance of arrays
- Perf: Improve performance of useSelector when passing an observable directly
- Perf: Improve performance of the For component

## 1.0.0-rc.32

- Change: `useObserve` runs the function less often
- Change: `when` checks truthiness instead of readiness. Use `whenReady` if you want empty objects and arrays to not count.
- Change: `afterBatch` runs after the batch instead of at the end of a batch, which is more useful
- Perf: Changes are internally batched by node instead of by listener, resulting in fewer `onChange` calls

## 1.0.0-rc.31

- Feat: Add a sortValues function to For for use with eachValues

## 1.0.0-rc.30

- Feat: Add support for a _keyExtractor field to return an arbitrary key value on arrays
- Change: internals is exported as an object instead of a separate export path

## 1.0.0-rc.29

- Fix: Prevent batches from running recursively
- Fix: The second "reaction" paremeter in `observe` sometimes had an incorrect `previous` value

## 1.0.0-rc.27

- Fix: `getPrevious()` in onChange was sometimes incorrect during a batch

## 1.0.0-rc.26

- Perf: Removed IndexedDB preloader because it's actually slower because of the time it takes to copy the data across the Web Worker bridge

## 1.0.0-rc.23

- Perf: Miscellaneous micro-optimizing

## 1.0.0-rc.22

- Feat: Add a useObservableNextRouter hook for Next.js
- Perf: Persistence plugins queue into a microtask to bundle saves together

## 1.0.0-rc.21

- Feat: Added `eachValues` prop to For to map the values of an object

## 1.0.0-rc.20

- Fix: useSelector now uses useSyncExternalStore under the hood to support Suspense better

## 1.0.0-rc.19

- Fix: mergeIntoObservable was sometimes deleting undefined fields

## 1.0.0-rc.17

- Perf: Sped up IndexedDB plugin and removed the preloader because it was actually slower

## 1.0.0-rc.16

- Fix: Fast Refresh sometimes resetting observables -By @GiFarina

## 1.0.0-rc.14

- Perf: Running notifications in large objects sped up

## 1.0.0-rc.10

- Fix: `afterBatch` was not working correctly if run from within a batch

## 1.0.0-rc.4

- Feature: Added two way `computed`

## 1.0.0-rc.2

- Feature: `batch` has a new `onComplete `batch(callback, onComplete)` parameter to run a function after the batch commits. This can be useful for cleaning up a temporary state while batching.
- Fix: onChange with `initial` option fires immediately rather than going through batching process
- Fix: Applying pending changes on load was writing back to local persistence unnecessarily
- Perf: Improve performance of `mergeIntoObservable` by just doing a `set` if a target property is empty and doesn't need merging logic
- Perf: Improve persistence overall by using more targeted approaches than `mergeIntoObservable`

## 1.0.0-rc.1

- Fix: Incrementing a value from 0 with a function (`value.set((prev) => prev + 1)`) was not firing a callback the first time


## 1.0.0-rc.0

- Breaking: `onChange` function changed to take an options object as a second parameter with a new `initial` option that makes it fire immediately with the current value.
- Breaking: `onChange` callback receives an object parameter instead of many arguments. This adds more flexibility for callers who care about different values in the change object.
- Fix: `mergeIntoObservable` was not working correctly in some edge cases.
- Fix: IndexedDB persistence improved for many edge cases, with some fixes and performance improvements
- Fix: Persistence layers overall improved with more stability and better performance

## 0.23.1

- Fix: Not notifying on change of dates

## 0.23.0

- Breaking: Improved the criteria of when to notify up parents for changes on objects to run only when something inside it has changed, so setting/assigning the same object onto itself will not notify. It's unlikely but possible that may be a breaking change for you if you depended on things re-computing/re-rendering even if nothing changed.
- Breaking: Removed automatically treating DOM nodes and React elements as opaque objects - it added most likely unnecessary extra code and is easily solved in a more generic way. If you're storing those in observables, wrap them in `opaqueObject(...)`.
- Feature: Added `is*` functions to export
- Perf: Batching was never clearing its safety timeouts, so thousands of changes at once could have been slow

### Persistence

- Breaking: Remove the flexibility for saving arrays and basic objects (can do that with itemID now).
- Feature: IndexedDB supports adjustData, prefixID, itemID, fieldTransforms

## 0.22.2

### Persistence
- Fix: IndexedDB preloader not loading correctly if it has to await the promise

## 0.22.1

### Persistence
- Fix: Changes deep in an object were not saving to IndexedDB correctly
- Fix: Metadata not saving properly from remote changes

## 0.22.0

- Breaking: Local Storage is no longer used as default persistence (to reduce build size for those not using it). Please configure persistence at the beginning of your application: https://legendapp.com/open-source/state/persistence/
- Breaking: Moved persist plugins to /persist-plugins export path
- Breaking: Internals of persistence plugins were changed to better support async loading and metadata. If you had made your own persistence plugin the changes should be straightforward, or create an Issue and we'll help migrate it.
- Breaking: `when` behavior tweaked to not be triggered by empty objects or empty arrays
- Feature: `ObservablePersistIndexedDB` for persisting to IndexedDB

- Types: Improved types for strict mode

## 0.21.12

- Feat: For remote persistence plugins: Add options to disable local or remote sync, support loading remote even if there's no local

## 0.21.11

- Feat: Added useObservableQuery hook
- Feat: Added local persistence options, starting with mmkv configuration
- Change: Removed persist option from useObservable. It was a bad idea - it imported the whole /persist export. A better solution will come in an update soon.

## 0.21.10

- Fix: `createObservableHook` was not working with initialState as a function
- Perf: Reduce number of renders by not notifying if setting with an unchanged object or array

## 0.21.9

- Fix: A circular import warning in the react export

- Fix: `reactive` was overriding the given function, causing problems if wrapping an external component and conditionally rendering the original component
- Fix: `useObservableReducer` was not working with non-function arguments

## 0.21.3

- Fix: History not saving the initial object creation
- Fix: Crash when modifying an array was that included as initial value to an observable

## 0.21.2

- Fix: React Native Switch was not two-way binding properly

## 0.21.1

- Feat: Added a deps array to useComputed so it can be updated if dependencies change
- Feat: Added reactive types for SVGs

## 0.21.0

See https://legendapp.com/open-source/state/migrating for more details.

- Breaking: Changed observable `onChange` callback to take an array of changes rather than a single changed value because batched changes were only showing the most recently changed child value.
- Breaking: Rename react-components export from legend to Legend
- Feat: `trackHistory` creates an observable that tracks a version history of a target observable
- Feat: persistObservable caches pending changes offline so if they're not successfully saved remotely, it attempts to sync them after remote persistence is loaded

## 0.20.5

- Fix: Types of React Native components were not supporting refs properly

## 0.20.4

- Fix: Reactive components not forwarding refs properly

## 0.20.3

- Fix: Tracing functions crashing if component is not an observer

## 0.20.2

- Fix: mergeIntoObservable was overwriting object children with undefined values

## 0.20.1

- Fix: `observer` was not auto-memoizing after the rewrite in 0.20.0
- Fix: `For` which a child function auto-observes

## 0.20.0

- Breaking: Changed behavior of `observe` and `useObserve` so that they have a callback parameter, useful for observing an event and doing something only when it changes. It also has a new `previous` parameter to compare to the previous run which depends on a return value, so the previous behavior using the return value is moved into the callback parameter. If you were returning false to cancel observing, you can now use `e.cancel = true`. And if you were returning a cleanup function you can use `e.onCleanup = () => ...`. It also adds a `num` param to know how many times it's run.
- Breaking: Renamed event `dispatch` to `fire`
- Breaking: Removed deprecated hooking into internal dispatcher
- Breaking: Removed deprecated Bindable components
- Feat: Added a callback parameter to `useObserve`, useful for observing an event and doing something only when it changes
- Feat: Added useMount and useUnmount lifecycle hooks to encourage getting away from useEffect
- Feat: `useObserve` has a second callback parameter which will run after the selector. This can be useful for passing an `observable` or `event` as the first parameter.
- Fix: `reactive` and `observe` components were sometimes not retaining their static properties (like id). They now use a Proxy wrapper instead of an HOC, which reduces component tree depth and avoids any other bugs from wrapping components and forwarding refs.
- Fix: `event` was not working correctly in selectors
- Fix: The two-way binding components are always controlled, even if the `value$` is undefined
- Types: Improved types of `computed` and `useComponent` to accept a Promise

## 0.19.8

- Fix: Reactive components were sometimes not working in React Native https://github.com/LegendApp/legend-state/issues/32

## 0.19.7

- Feat: Added `itemProps` to `For` component to pass extra props to items

- Fix: Directly rendering primitive observables was erroring in getNode sometimes

## 0.19.6

- Feat: Observable booleans have a `toggle()` function
- Perf: Observable primities are a simple function instead of a class, reducing code size and should be a bit faster
- Types: Improved typings of For component

## 0.19.5

- Fix: Persisting primitives

## 0.19.4

- Feat: Added `useObservableReducer` hook, which is the same as `useReducer` but it updates an observable rather than triggering a render https://github.com/LegendApp/legend-state/issues/20

## 0.19.3

- Fix: Fast Refresh not disposing `observe()` correctly https://github.com/LegendApp/legend-state/issues/25
- Fix: React hooks error in Show when toggling if it has a children function
- Types: Improved types of For to handle computed observables better
- Types: Improved types of useObservable to support Promises

## 0.19.2

- Feat: `createObservableHook` for converting other hooks that use `useState` to return an observable

## 0.19.1

- Feat: Support two-way binding multiple props, starting with checked$ on input

## 0.19.0

This is a big one, with a breaking change to stop observing all React components automatically. See https://legendapp.com/open-source/state/migrating for more details.

- Breaking: No longer observing all React components automatically. Please use `observer` or `useSelector` for observable tracking.

## 0.17.1
- Fix: Wrapped React hook injection in try/catch because it was sometimes causing errors like when hydrating in Next.js

## 0.17.0

This is a big one, with mainly a breaking change to how primitives work, so see https://legendapp.com/open-source/state/migrating for more details.

- Breaking: Primitives in state are now returned as observable objects like everything else, and you can use `get()` or `.value` to access/modify the value
- Breaking: Removed `obs()` function
- Breaking: `set()` no longer has a keyed version because it's not needed now that we can dot through undefined nodes
- Breaking: Renamed `useComputed` to `useSelector`
- Feature: Because primitives are returned as observables, we can now dot through undefined nodes
- Feature: Added `peek()` function, which is the same as `get(false)`
- Feature: `useComputed` returns a `computed` observable
- Feature: `useObserve` creates an `observe` context
- Feature: `computed` is now lazy and won't activate until its value is accessed for the first time
- Feature: `Show` has a `wrap` prop to wrap children, for example with <AnimatePresence>
- Feature: Allow observable with no parameters, initialized to undefined
- Feature: `verifyNotTracking()` to make sure that components never re-render
- Perf: Observables created as primitives use a class instead of a Proxy, to speed up the scenario of using tons of primitive observables
- Perf: Listeners that don't care about the value (like observe and React components) skip passing all the parameters to callbacks
- Fix: The new `enableLegendStateReact()` is more stable and works better with nested components
- Fix: Rendering observables directly is more stable, especially in React Native
- Fix: Modifying listeners in an `observe` was sometimes causing infinite loops

## 0.16.1
- Fix: A component going from tracking nodes to not tracking nodes was causing errors

## 0.16.0

See https://legendapp.com/open-source/state/migrating for more details.

- Breaking: Removed `observer` HOC
- Feat: No longer need `observer` HOC - Call `enableLegendStateReact()` at the beginning of your app, and then all components automatically observe any accessed state
- Feat: `when` callback receives the current value as the parameter
- Feat: Add join to array functions that create shallow listeners

## 0.15.3
- Feat: Observables can easily switch back and forth between being an object or a primitive, and observable primitives have less overhead

## 0.15.2
- Fix: Crash when creating an observable starting undefined

## 0.15.1
- Fix: Assigning an object with function children

## 0.15.0

This is a big one with many breaking (but good) changes, so see https://legendapp.com/open-source/state/migrating for more details. We're making a lot of breaking changes all once so it's not too impactful.

- Breaking: There are now three levels of safety: Unsafe, Default, Safe. "Default" is new and allows direct assignment to primitives but prevents directly assigning to everything else. The previous default behavior was "Unsafe" so you may see errors if you were directly assigning to objects/arrays/etc... Replace those with `.set(...)` or pass in `false` as the second parameter to `observable` to go back to "Unsafe" mode.
- Breaking: Renamed `ref()` to `obs()`
- Breaking: The array optimizations are now opt-in, because they can potentially have some unexpected behavior if modifying the DOM externally. You can enable them by using the `For` component with the `optimized` prop.
- Breaking: Replaced `shallow` with a `Tracking` namespace, to add Optimized tracking. Change `shallow` to `Tracking.shallow` to get the previous behavior, or `Tracking.optimized` on an array to get the optimized behavior.
- Breaking: Changed `observableBatcher` to export the batching functions directly instead of as a namespace
- Breaking: Removed `onChangeShallow`, `onTrue`, `onEquals`, and `onHasValue` in favor of the new `effect` and `when` which automatically track any accessed observables.
- Breaking: Renamed primitive observables' wrapping value from `current` to `value`.
- Breaking: Renamed `observableComputed` to `computed` and `observableEvent` to `event`.
- Breaking: Renamed the bindable components from `LS` to `Bindable` and they now export from '@legendapp/state/react-components' or '@legendapp/state/react-native-components'
- Feat: Observable primitives can be rendered directly in React
- Feat: Added `observe`, which can run arbitrary code while tracking all accessed observables.
- Feat: Added `when`, which can run functions when the predicate returns a truthy value.
- Feat: Added `Switch` component
- Feat: Support creating an observable with a Promise as a value, which will update itself when the promise resolves.
- Feat: A `lockObservable` function to prevent writes
- Fix: Observables with arrays at the root were not notifying listeners properly
- Fix: Accessing `current` (now `value`) on a primitive observable was not tracking as expected
- Fix: Improve types of Memo/Computed/Show components so that they require functions by default, and are expanded to not need functions when referencing the babel types.

## 0.14.5

- Feat: `onChange` has a `runImmediately` option
- Fix: `.ref()` and `.get()` inside an `observer` do reference counting so they don't untrack too aggressively
- Fix: `delete()` was notifying listeners with the value undefined, but the key not yet deleted
- Fix: `observer` was sometimes missing updates occurring between render and mount

## 0.11.0-beta.7
- Fix: New set option with function parameter was breaking persistence

## 0.11.0-beta.3
- Fix: observer was not working the first time in StrictMode
- Fix: observer was not cleaning up old listeners when the the tracked observables changed
