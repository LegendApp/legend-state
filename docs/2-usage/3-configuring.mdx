Legend-State is designed to have a lean core that allows you and your team to add additional features, so it has configuration functions to add features as you like.

These functions add features and augment the TypeScript interface to add the new functions, so just importing the file adds the interface.

These configuration functions only need to be called once, before their effects are used, and then they will work anywhere. It should generally be at the top of the file that's the entry point of your app or is imported everywhere, or it could be at the top of a global state file.

### enableReactUse

This adds a `use()` function to all observables, which gets the value and makes the component reactive to the observable changing. It simply runs `useSelector(obs)` under the hood.

```js
import { enableReactUse } from '@legendapp/state/config/enableReactUse';
enableReactUse()
```

Now you can use `use()`.

```jsx
import { observable } from '@legendapp/state';
const state$ = observable({ test: 'hi' })

function Component() {
    // This makes this component responsive to test changing
    const test = state$.test.use()

    return <div>{test}</div>
}
```

### enableReactComponents, enableReactNativeComponents

Legend-State provides reactive versions of all platform components with reactive props. To use these components first enable the version for your platform:

```js
// React
import { enableReactComponents } from "@legendapp/state/config/enableReactComponents"
enableReactComponents()

// React Native
import { enableReactNativeComponents } from "@legendapp/state/config/enableReactNativeComponents"
enableReactNativeComponents()
```

Now you can use `Reactive`.

```jsx
import { Reactive } from "@legendapp/state/react"

function Component() {
    return (
        <Reactive.div
            $style={() => ({
                color: state.age.get() > 5 ? 'green' : 'red'
            })}
            $className={() => state.age.get() > 5 ? 'kid' : 'baby'}
        />
    )
}
```

See [Reactive components](../fine-grained-reactivity/#reactive-components) for more details.

### enableDirectAccess

This enables accessing and setting the raw value of an observable directly. It's a shorthand for `get()` and `set(...)`.

```js
import { enableDirectAccess } from '@legendapp/state/config/enableDirectAccess';
enableDirectAccess()
```

Now you can access/modify observables directly.

```js
import { observable } from '@legendapp/state';

const state = observable({ test: 'hi', num: 0 })

// $ is a shorthand for get()
const testValue = state.test.$

// Assign to $ as a shorthand for set()
state.test.$ = 'hello'

// Assign objects too just like you can with set()
state.$ = { test: 'hello' }

// Incrementing works as you'd expect
state.$ ++
```
### enableDirectPeek

This enables accessing and setting the raw value of an observable directly without tracking or notifying listeners. Getting with `._` is a shorthand for `peek()` and assigning to `._` modifies the underlying data without notifying. Modifying data without notifying is likely necessary in only very specific scenarios so use it with care.

```js
import { enableDirectPeek } from '@legendapp/state/config/enableDirectPeek';
enableDirectPeek()
```

Now you can access/modify observables directly without notifying.

```js
import { observable } from '@legendapp/state';

const state = observable({ test: 'hi', num: 0 })

// _ is a shorthand for peek()
const testValue = state.test._

// Assign to _ to modify the underlying object without notifying listeners
state.test._ = 'hello'

// Assign objects too
state._ = { test: 'hello' }
```

### enableReactDirectRender, enableLegendStateReact (Deprecated)

> Note that these are deprecated in favor of using [Memo](../fine-grained-reactivity/#render-an-observableselector-directly). Although it was cool and terse, it was unclear at a glance that the element was reactive. Memo is exactly the same behavior, but more descriptive.

This enables rendering observables directly into React, creates an element that's reactive to the observable changing.

```jsx
import { observable } from '@legendapp/state';
import { enableReactDirectRender } from '@legendapp/state/config/enableReactDirectRender';
enableReactDirectRender()

const state$ = observable({ test: 'hi' })

function Component() {
    // The observable can now be rendered directly to create a self-reactive elemtn
    return <div>{state$.test}</div>
}
```
